# Federated Learning
This is a repository for the Federated Learning project for the thesis "Federované učenie v zdravotníctve".
Working with Heart Disease UCI dataset. Which has 320 000 records and 18 attributes. After corelation analysis and
feature selection I decided to use 8 attributes. The dataset is divided into 3 parts. 70% for training, 10% for validation
and 20% for testing. After hyperparameter tuning I achieved 0.75 - 0.80 accuracy on the test set. Precision 0.9, Recall
0.77 and F1 score 0.83. I'm planning to make a web application for this project and also for data visualization.
